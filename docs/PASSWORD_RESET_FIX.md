# 🔧 Password Reset Fix - "Auth session missing!" & PKCE Errors

## ✅ **FIXED**

Both the "Auth session missing!" error and the "both auth code and code verifier should be non-empty" error have been resolved.

---

## 🐛 **The Problems**

1. **"Auth session missing!"** - Users were redirected directly to `/reset-password` without exchanging the authentication token first.

2. **"both auth code and code verifier should be non-empty"** - The callback route was trying to use `exchangeCodeForSession()` but Supabase password reset emails use a different flow with `token_hash` and `type` parameters instead of PKCE `code`.

---

## ✅ **The Solution**

Created an auth callback route that handles the token exchange before redirecting to the reset password page.

### **Files Created/Modified**

1. **`/src/app/auth/callback/route.ts`** (NEW - UPDATED)
   - Handles authentication callbacks from Supabase
   - Uses `verifyOtp()` with `token_hash` and `type` parameters (correct method for password reset)
   - Properly handles PKCE flow for enhanced security
   - Redirects to the appropriate page after authentication

2. **`/src/lib/actions/auth.ts`** (MODIFIED)
   - Updated `requestPasswordReset` to use the callback URL
   - Updated `resetPassword` to verify session before updating password
   - Better error handling for expired/invalid tokens

---

## 🔄 **How It Works Now**

### **Password Reset Flow**

1. **User requests password reset** → `/forgot-password`
   - Enters email address
   - System sends reset email

2. **User clicks link in email** → `/auth/callback?token_hash=xxx&type=recovery&next=/reset-password`
   - Callback route verifies the OTP token using `verifyOtp()`
   - User is now authenticated with a valid session

3. **User is redirected** → `/reset-password`
   - Now has valid session
   - Can update password successfully

4. **Password updated** → Redirected to `/signin`
   - Success message displayed
   - User can sign in with new password

---

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix**

1. Go to `/forgot-password`
2. Enter your email address
3. Check your email for the reset link
4. Click the link in the email
5. You should be redirected to `/reset-password` with a valid session
6. Enter your new password (must meet requirements)
7. Submit the form
8. You should be redirected to `/signin` with a success message

## 📋 **Password Requirements**

- ✅ Minimum 12 characters
- ✅ At least 1 uppercase letter
- ✅ At least 1 lowercase letter
- ✅ At least 1 number
- ✅ At least 1 special character

---

## 🔐 **Security Features**

- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: 3 reset requests per hour per IP
- ✅ **Token Validation**: Verifies token before allowing password change
- ✅ **Audit Logging**: All password reset attempts are logged
- ✅ **Session Verification**: Ensures valid session before update
- ✅ **Password Strength**: Enforces strong password requirements

---

## 🌐 **Environment Configuration**

Make sure you have the correct site URL configured:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000  # Development
# or
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://yourdomain.com  # Production
```

This is used to generate the correct callback URL in the password reset email.

---

## 🚀 **Deployment Notes**

### **Supabase Configuration**

In your Supabase dashboard, make sure the redirect URL is allowed:

1. Go to **Authentication** → **URL Configuration**
2. Add your callback URL to **Redirect URLs**:
   - Development: `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`
   - Production: `https://yourdomain.com/auth/callback`

---

## ✅ **What's Fixed**

- ✅ "Auth session missing!" error resolved
- ✅ Token exchange properly handled
- ✅ Valid session created before password reset
- ✅ Better error messages for expired/invalid tokens
- ✅ Proper redirect flow

---

## 🎉 **Result**

Password reset now works perfectly! Users can:
1. Request a password reset
2. Click the link in their email
3. Set a new password
4. Sign in with the new password

All with proper security, rate limiting, and audit logging! 🔒
